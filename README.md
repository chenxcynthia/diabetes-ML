I co-authored a paper in Cell Systems based on the work done in this project.

Description:
Type 2 Diabetes affects 200 million people in the world. However, the problem of predicting diabetes onset for prediabetic patients still remains unsolved. In this project, we aim to accurately predict and classify whether a prediabetic patient will be diagnosed with diabetes in the following 3 months. To this end, we used statistical machine learning techniques to analyze previous omics data (metabolomics, microbiome, cytomics, and proteomics) from the patient. In addition, we provide correlation analyses that determine the optimal microbiome level for plasma blood glucose level prediction.

Data that is mentioned in code is not publicly available due to confidentiality.
